# DigitalHome Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for the development of a “Smart
House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of
HomeOwner Inc. A “Smart House” is a home management system that allows
home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that
brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature,
humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications. The Smart House
components consist of household devices (e.g., a heating and air conditioning
unit, a security system, and small appliances and lighting units, etc.), sensors
and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components,
and a computer system, which will manage the components.

The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the
DigitalHome Customer Need Statement. It is made up of a list of the principal
features of the system. This initial version of DigitalHome will be a limited
prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make
business decisions about the future commercial development of
DigitalHomeOwner products and services. Hence, the SRS is not intended as a
comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalHome requirements. There is
a supplementary document that provides additional detail and information about
the DigitalHome requirements: the Digital Home Use Case Model [HO2010].
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwner Division, in
consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.

## 3. Overall description

### 3.1 Product Description and Scope

The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will
allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home.
The user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web
server or on a local home server. The DH web server communicates, through a
home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and controller devices in the
home.

The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition
[HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to
be made about future development of a commercial product. The scope of the
project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature,
humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the
use of a web-ready device. The prototype DH software system will be situated in
a simulated environment. There will be no actual physical home and all sensors
and controllers will be simulated.

### 3.2 Users Description

#### 3.2.1 DigitalHome Users

1. The general user shall be able to use the DH system
capabilities to monitor and control the environment in his/her
home.
2. The general user is familiar with the layout of his/her home and
the location of sensor and control devices (for temperature, for
humidity, and for power to small appliances and lighting units).
3. Although the general user is not familiar with the technical
features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with the use of a
web interface and can perform simple web operations (logging
in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitting
information and requests via a web interface).
4. A Master user will be designated, who shall be able to change
the configuration of the system. For example, a Master User
shall be able to add a user account or change the default
parameter settings. He/she will have the same right as the DH
Technician, described in section 3.2.2.4.

#### 3.2.2 DigitalHome Technician

1. A DH Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining
the configuration of a DH system.
2. A DH Technician has experience with the type of hardware,
software, and web services associated with a system like the
DH system.
3. A DH Technician is specially trained by DigitalHomeOwner to be
familiar with the functionality, architecture, and operation of the
DH system product.
4. A DH Technician will have rights beyond the DH General User,
capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration
of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and establishing
user accounts), and starting and stopping operation of the DH
System.

### 3.3 Development Constraints

1. The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome System (as specified in this
document) must be completed within twelve months of inception.
2. The development team will consist of five engineers. The
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and
communication support.
3. The development team will use the development process specified by
the Digital HomeOwner Inc.
4. Where possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used,
accepted, and available hardware and software technology and
standards, both for product elements and for development tools. See
section 3.4 for additional detail.
5. Because of potential market competition for DigitalHome products, the
cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.),
for this project should be minimized. As part of the final project report
the development team will describe their efforts to minimize costs,
including price comparisons between DH elements and
comparable/competitive elements.
6. The DH system will be tested in a simulated environment. There will be
no actual physical home and all sensors and controllers will be
simulated. However, the simulated environment will be realistic and
adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home
and to real sensors and controllers.
7. Major changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must
be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.

### 3.4 Operational Environment

the system responds to a user with a clear, descriptive message when
an error or an exceptional condition occurs.

### 5.3 Safety Requirements

1. Although there are no specific safety requirements, high system
reliability is important to insure there are no system failures in carrying
out user requests. Such failures might affect the safety of home
dwellers (e.g., security breaches, inadequate lighting in dark spaces,
inappropriate temperature and humidity for people who are in ill-health,
or powering certain appliances when young children are present).

    2. Use of abstraction, information hiding and module
    independence in system design; and
    3. Use of IEEE standards [IEEE830, IEEE1008, IEEE1016,
    IEEE1028] and the HomeOwner Coding Standard [HO4710].
2. Although the product produced under this document will be a
“prototype” version, all modules and components of this prototype
version shall be designed and implemented in such a manner that it
may be incorporated in a fully specified commercial version of the
DigitalHome System.

### 5.6 Business Rules

1. All system documents (Software Requirements Specification,
Architectural Design Specification, Module Detailed Design, Module
Source Code, and all Test Plans) shall be up-to-date, use the
Homeowner document format [HO2305] and reside in the HomeOwner
Document Archive at completion of the project.
2. HomeOwner has designated object-oriented development, using UML
2.0, as the preferred method for development of software for
HomeOwner products. Exceptions to this rule must be approved by the
CIO.

### 5.7 User Documentation:

1. The DigitalHome System shall provide users with online
documentation about the DigitalHome system installed in their home.
The user documentation shall include the following:
    1. An FAQ section – a set of “Frequently Asked Questions” about
    use and maintenance of the DigitalHome System (e.g., “How do
    I change my password?”, “Where to I go to get DigitalHome
    support?”).
    2. A section that explains how DH parameters are set and sensor
    values are read. This shall include information on limitations and
